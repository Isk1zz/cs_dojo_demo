// ================================================
// Unit 8 Dojo — Machine Learning
// What ML is, why it needs data, and the three learning
// paradigms: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement.
//
// SCHEMA NOTE (new in module 5):
//   explain.blocks[]  — an array of { heading?, text } instead of a
//                       single `text` string. Long concepts get room to
//                       breathe. app.js falls back to `text` for m1–m4.
//   explain.sources[] — { ref, note } citations, rendered in a
//                       collapsible box so a reader can verify claims.
//
// ANSWER KEYS: `correct` is deliberately spread across 0–3.
// Modules 1–4 put 88% of answers on B or C, which made them guessable.
// Keep new content balanced — check with:
//   grep -ho "correct: [0-3]" data_m5.js | sort | uniq -c
