# games/ — arcade (games + story)

The Arcade screen has **two tabs**: Games and Story. `story/` registers itself
here at load:

```js
Dojo.Arcade.registerTab({ id: "story", label: "📖 Story", render(body) {...} });
```

That is the whole merge — one call. Story keeps its own folder, its own doc and
its own stylesheet, so it is still a one-folder session. A branch that wants a
place on this screen adds a tab rather than taking a lobby slot of its own.

**Skeleton. The gate is real; the games are not written.**

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `games.js` | Shell, registry, unlocks, the gate, `beginRound`/`settle` |
| `crash.js` | **Built.** Multiplier game — owns its own curve |
| `hilo.js` | **Built.** Higher/lower — owns its odds table |
| `blackjack.js` | **Built.** Classic 21 — owns the rules |

All three games are in. `raise(round, amount)` exists for Blackjack's double
down: extra money into a live round still goes through `games.js`, never
`DB.spendMoney` from a game file.

## Unlocks
Each game is bought **once, with money**, and stored in the inventory as
`game_<id>`. Same coin as food and shelter.

| Game | Unlock |
|---|---|
| Crash | $75 |
| Hi-Lo | $150 |
| Blackjack | $300 |

Charge can never buy one. `beginRound(stake, gameId)` refuses if the game
isn't unlocked, so the gate holds even if a card is rendered wrong.
Stylesheet: `styles/games.css` (cards reuse `shop.css` on purpose).

## The gate — already enforced
Per round: **1 ticket + 10 energy + a bite out of vitals**, stake capped at $50
and at the wallet. Tickets: **7 per 6 hours, ceiling 7.**

Worth knowing which limit actually binds: 7 tickets is more than a full energy
bar allows, so **energy caps a sitting** (10 rounds on a full bar) and
**tickets cap the day**. Raising tickets alone won't open the floodgates;
raising energy would. If any vital is at or below 15, `beginRound` returns `null`
and `canPlay()` is false — you are too weak to play. The Library is never gated
this way; see `shop/SHOP.md`.
Tickets: **2 per 6 hours, ceiling 2.** A round cannot start unless
`spendTicket()` *and* `spendEnergy()` both succeed, and a partial failure
refunds the stake.

That ceiling is the point. The arcade is a break between study sessions, not
an income line — the Garden is the income line, and it pays for *remembering
things*. Two entries per six hours also caps what a bad run can cost.

## The seam — use it
```js
const round = Games.beginRound(stake);   // null if the round can't start
if (!round) return;
// ... play ...
Games.settle(round, payout);             // payout INCLUDES the stake; 0 = loss
```

**Never call `DB.addMoney` or `DB.spendMoney` from game logic.** Every stake
and every payout goes through these two functions so there is one place to
audit, log, and later rate-limit.

Register a game at load:
```js
Dojo.Games.register({ id, name, tagline, icon, mount(container, api) });
```
The shell renders any registered game as playable and any planned-but-absent
one as "Not built yet", so games can land one at a time.

## Crash — the maths (`crash.js`)

```
crash = 1 / (1 - u),   u uniform on [0, 1)
```

This gives `P(crash >= m) = 1/m`, so cashing out at any target `m` returns
`m x (1/m) = 1` — a perfectly fair game with no edge. So **4% of rounds are
forced to bust instantly at 1.00x**, making the expected return exactly 96%
*whatever multiplier you aim for*.

That flatness is the point: there is no clever target. Verified by simulation
at 1.5x / 2x / 5x / 10x over 200k rounds each — all land on 96%.

- `MAX_MULT` 25x caps the tail. Without it one lucky round at the $50 stake
  cap could pay four figures and make the Garden pointless. 25 x $50 = $1,250
  is already the largest number in the app.
- The multiplier doubles every 4 seconds (`GROWTH_SECONDS`).
- The crash point is rolled **once, up front**, so waiting can't nudge it.
- One round can be live at a time; `stop()` kills the frame loop, and leaving
  the panel calls it.

## Hi-Lo — the odds (`hilo.js`)

**A tie loses.** That one rule is what makes the table clean:

```
w      = cards that win the call
payout = 0.96 x 13 / w
EV     = (w/13) x payout = 0.96,  every card, both directions
```

Flat 96% whichever card is showing and whichever way you call — same property
as Crash. There is no card that's a better bet, so a player can't be punished
for not knowing an odds table. Measured range across all 24 valid calls:
95.6–96.2% (rounding to cents).

Sample: A higher 1.04x, 2 higher 1.13x, 10 higher 4.16x, K higher impossible
(button disabled).

A push-on-tie version was tried first and does not work. Calling "higher" on an
ace wins 12/13 and pushes 1/13, so it can never lose — the house could only
take a cut by paying under 1x on a *win*, which is nonsense. Ties losing
removes that whole class of problem.

## Blackjack — the rules (`blackjack.js`)

Six-deck shoe, reshuffled per round. Dealer hits below 17, stands on 17 or
more including soft 17. Blackjack pays 3:2, push returns the stake, double
down on the opening two cards. **Splits are out of scope for v1.**

### Why it's the $300 unlock
Crash and Hi-Lo both return a flat 96% no matter what the player does — there
is nothing to learn. Blackjack is the opposite: played well it returns around
99%, played carelessly rather less. The expensive unlock buys a game where
paying attention is worth something, which is the only kind of "skill" this
app should be selling. That answers the open question from stage 3: the
pricier unlock buys a *better game*, not a better rake.

Card counting across rounds is pointless here anyway — the shoe is rebuilt
every round, and two tickets per six hours caps the sample.

## One honest flag
Real-money-style casino mechanics in a study app carry two real-world
problems, worth deciding on before this branch is finished, not after:

1. **Store policy.** Apple and Google both treat simulated gambling as a
   restricted category, and it interacts badly with any plan to sell a premium
   currency for real money. If "stars purchasable for money" and a casino
   coexist, some jurisdictions treat that as gambling regardless of intent.
2. **Audience.** The users are students, and a chunk of them are under 18.

Neither kills the idea — a closed-loop currency you can't cash out is the
normal way this is handled — but "the money must never be purchasable *and*
stakeable" is a decision to make now, because it changes the schema.
